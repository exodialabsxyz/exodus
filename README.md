## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Docker (optional, for isolated execution mode)
- An API key for your chosen LLM provider (Google Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/exodialabsxyz/exodus.git
cd exodus

# Install EXODUS
pip install -e .
```

### Initial Configuration

1. **Copy the example configuration:**
   ```bash
   cp settings.toml.example settings.toml
   ```

2. **Configure your LLM provider:**
   Edit `settings.toml` and add your API key:
   ```toml
   [llm]
   default_model = "gemini/gemini-2.5-flash"
   default_provider = "litellm"
   custom_api_base = ""  # Optional: for local models or custom endpoints
   
   [llm.default_provider_config]
   api_key = "your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Configure execution mode:**
   ```toml
   [agent]
   default_agent = "triage_agent"
   max_iterations = 100
   execution_mode = "local"  # or "docker"
   
   [agent.execution.docker]
   default_image = "parrotsec/security:7.0"
   default_image_name = "exodus_container"
   ```

4. **Set logging level:**
   ```toml
   [logging]
   level = "INFO"  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
   format = "[exodus] %(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
   ```

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Start a Chat Session

```bash
# Start with default agent
exodus-cli chat

# Start with a specific agent
exodus-cli chat --agent triage_agent

# Use a different model
exodus-cli chat --model "gemini/gemini-2.5-pro"

# Adjust temperature
exodus-cli chat --temperature 0.7
```

### Example Usage

```bash
# Start with the triage agent for automatic task routing
exodus-cli chat --agent triage_agent

> "Scan 192.168.1.1 for open ports and services"
# triage_agent will automatically transfer to recon_agent
# recon_agent will execute the scan and provide results
```

### Using Ollama (Local Models)

```toml
[llm]
default_model = "ollama/granite4:latest"
custom_api_base = "http://localhost:11434"

[llm.default_provider_config]
api_key = "ollama_apikey"
```

## 🔧 Creating Custom Plugins

Create powerful tools for your agents with just a simple decorator. EXODUS automatically generates the OpenAI-compatible schema:

```python
from exodus.core.decorators import tool

@tool(
    name="port_scanner",
    type="cli",
    description="Scans ports on a target host using nmap"
)
def port_scanner(target: str, ports: str = "1-1000") -> str:
    """Scans the specified ports on the target."""
    return f"nmap -p {ports} {target}"

# Register your plugin class
class SecurityPlugin:
    @staticmethod
    def get_tools():
        return {
            port_scanner.tool_name: port_scanner,
        }
```

To make your plugin discoverable, register it in your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."exodus.plugins.tools"]
security = "your_package.plugins:SecurityPlugin"
```

EXODUS will automatically discover and load all plugins from the `exodus.plugins.tools` entry point group at startup.

**Plugin System:**
- **Python tools**: Execute code directly in your environment
- **CLI tools**: Return shell commands executed in isolated containers
- **Auto-validation**: Pydantic models generated automatically from type hints
- **Auto-discovery**: Plugins loaded via Python entry points (`exodus.plugins.tools`)
- **Distributable**: Share your plugins as PyPI packages

## 🤖 Creating Custom Agents

Define agents using simple TOML configuration files:

```toml
[agent]
name = "pentest_agent"
description = "Specialized agent for penetration testing"
system_prompt = "You are a pentesting expert. Analyze targets and find vulnerabilities."
tools = ["port_scanner", "linux_command", "core_echo"]
handoffs = ["web_expert", "network_expert"]  # Agents this agent can delegate to
max_iterations = 50

[agent.llm]
model = "gemini/gemini-2.5-pro"
temperature = 0.7
```

**Agent Configuration:**
- **Declarative**: Define behavior in TOML, no code needed
- **Tool selection**: Choose which capabilities each agent has
- **LLM settings**: Per-agent model and parameters
- **System prompts**: Customize agent personality and expertise
- **Agent handoffs**: Delegate tasks to specialized agents dynamically

## 🔄 Agent Handoffs

EXODUS supports **dynamic agent delegation** where agents can transfer control to other specialized agents during execution:

```toml
[agent]
name = "triage_agent"
description = "Routes requests to specialized agents"
system_prompt = "Analyze the user's request and delegate to the appropriate expert."
tools = []
handoffs = ["security_expert", "code_analyst", "recon_specialist"]

[agent.llm]
temperature = 0.3
```

**How it works:**
1. Agent analyzes the task and determines if another agent is better suited
2. Calls `transfer_to_{agent_name}` with a reason for the handoff
3. Target agent receives context and continues execution
4. Shared memory preserves conversation history across handoffs
5. Global `max_iterations` prevents infinite loops across all agents

**Example workflow:**
```
User: "Scan this webapp and find SQL injection vulnerabilities"
  ↓
triage_agent → Identifies security task
  ↓
transfer_to_security_expert(reason="Requires vulnerability assessment")
  ↓
security_expert → Scans target, finds issues, needs code review
  ↓
transfer_to_code_analyst(reason="Review vulnerable code patterns")
  ↓
code_analyst → Provides fix recommendations
```

**Benefits:**
- **Specialized expertise**: Each agent focuses on what it does best
- **Automatic routing**: LLM decides when to delegate based on task requirements
- **Seamless context**: Conversation flows naturally between agents
- **No orchestrator needed**: Agents self-coordinate through handoffs

## 🐳 Secure Execution Modes

EXODUS provides multiple execution drivers for running tools safely:

**Docker Mode** (Recommended for isolated execution):
```toml
[agent]
execution_mode = "docker"

[agent.execution.docker]
default_image = "debian:latest"
default_image_name = "exodus_container"
```

- Isolated environment using any Docker image (Debian, Ubuntu, Kali, ParrotSec, Alpine, etc.)
- Automatic container lifecycle management
- Safe execution of commands without affecting host system
- Perfect for security tools or untrusted code execution

**Local Mode**:
```toml
[agent]
execution_mode = "local"
```

- Direct execution in your environment
- Faster for trusted tools
- Use for development and testing

## 🐳 Exodus Security Executor Container

EXODUS provides a specialized Docker container that runs an `exodus-server` daemon for executing Python-based tools in an isolated ParrotSec environment. Agents can communicate with this server via Unix sockets to execute EXODUS tools remotely.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t exodus-security-executor -f docker/exodus_security_executor/Dockerfile .

# Run the container
docker run -d --name exodus-executor exodus-security-executor

# View logs
docker logs -f exodus-executor
```

The container automatically starts the `exodus-server` on `/tmp/exodus/executor.sock` and loads the full EXODUS tool registry. This allows agents to execute Python tools in an isolated, security-focused environment.

For detailed documentation, communication protocols, and advanced usage, see [`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md)

## ⚡ Technical Highlights

EXODUS is built on **abstract, modular architecture** that enables endless possibilities:

- **Pluggable LLM Providers**: Abstract `LLMProvider` interface supports any model backend (LiteLLM, OpenAI, custom providers)
- **Extensible Memory Systems**: Implement your own `MemoryManager` (JSON, Redis, PostgreSQL, vector DBs)
- **Custom Execution Drivers**: Create new `ToolExecutionDriver` backends (Kubernetes, Lambda, SSH, etc.)
- **Plugin Registry**: Automatic tool discovery via Python entry points - share and reuse tools across projects
- **Tool Type System**: Define custom tool types beyond `python` and `cli`
- **Agent Orchestration**: Framework-ready for swarm patterns (hierarchical, collaborative, competitive)
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models auto-generated from type hints
- **Async-First**: Built on asyncio for concurrent agent execution
- **Minimal Core**: Only `httpx` and `pydantic` - everything else is pluggable

## 📦 Architecture
